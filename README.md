# MinecraftServer-WaterBottle-Spec
**Describe the server content, most are dev things**  
**For end gamer rules and guide, see:**  
https://github.com/mhtvsSFrpHdE/WaterBottle-MinecraftServer-Readme

The server codenamed, WaterBottle. Also called "Good old days".

When you're fishing in Minecraft, sometimes you'll get a bottle of water instead of fishes.  
That was the name. You'll need us, but you don't really need us,  
or even you can forge your own.

**Goal:**
- Create a gamer-centric experience.
- Everything you can get in the vanilla game is all available. No TNT or lava are blocked.
- Abandon toxin game design idea from gacha and game as a service era.

**Plugin list:**
