The server codenamed, WaterBottle. Also called "Good old days".

When you're fishing in Minecraft, sometimes you'll get a bottle of water instead of fishes.  
That was the name. You'll need us, but you don't really need us,  
or even you can forge your own.

**Goal:**
- Create a gamer-centric experience.
- No unlimited system-shop.
- Everything you can get in the vanilla game is all available. No TNT or lava are blocked.
- No teleport or warp point, but free fast-travel between station via riding an end dragon.
